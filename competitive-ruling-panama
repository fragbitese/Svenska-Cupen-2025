# Competitive ruling regarding Panama

The Svenska Cupen Competition Committee has today decided to disqualify the team Panama from further participation in this year’s tournament.

The decision has been made following an investigation carried out by Svenska Cupen, which revealed that one of the team’s players, **phenom**, has an active VAC ban on a Steam account linked to the player.

# What the decision means

Panama was one of the teams that qualified for the Svenska Cupen LAN Finals through their second-place finish in Group A of the Closed Qualifier. As the team is now disqualified, the spot will be awarded to Lilmix, who finished third in the group.

The decision also means that phenom is suspended from participating in all tournaments organized by Fragbite until 31 December 2028\.

# Rules regarding participants with active VAC bans

Players with an active VAC ban are not permitted to compete in Svenska Cupen. This prohibition is stated in the ruleset for the online qualifiers and in the general competition rules of Svenska Cupen.

## Rules for the online qualifiers

[Section 13](https://www.faceit.com/en/championship/3b36b75f-2cb2-42c1-a153-a05d6a9d520a/Svenska%20Cupen%202025%20-%20Qualifier%202/rules) states that players banned by VAC/Valve/ESIC cannot participate in the tournament.

## Svenska Cupen general competition rules

Under the section “[Integrity and Conduct of Rules](https://svenskacupen.gg/valve-specific-information/),” the disqualification rules for Svenska Cupen are listed. It states that Fragbite, as the organizer, has the right to deny participation to players with VAC-banned accounts.

# The investigation

After Group A of the Closed Qualifier had concluded, a report was submitted requesting that the team Panama be disqualified from Svenska Cupen. The report included claims that the player phenom had an active VAC ban on a separate Steam account from the one used during the competition.

Following the report, Fragbite initiated an investigation to determine the validity of the claims. The report contained technical evidence which Fragbite was able to verify with external, independent parties.

During Fragbite’s investigation, additional technical evidence was found linking the player to several Steam accounts with active VAC bans.

# Next Steps

The investigation will be handed over to The Esports Integrity Commission, and Fragbite is prepared to assist in their continued investigation.
